### Gauss-Seidel.py
A function that solves a partial differential equation using the Gauss-Seidel relaxation method with replacement and overrelaxation to speed up convergence. It also outputs an animated contour plot (greyscale) with *matplotlib*.
Included is an example implementation for a steady-state heat equation (Laplace equation).
